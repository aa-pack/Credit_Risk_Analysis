# Machine Learning Credit Risk Analysis

![credit_risk](./Images/credit_risk_image.jpg)

Credit Risk analysis was performed from loan data provided by Lending Club Loans using resampling techniques and multiple machine learning models.  A resampling notebook uses Native Random Oversampler, SMOTE, Cluster Centroids, and SMOTEEN to balance target labels in order to evaluate different machine learning models.  A machine learning notebook includes models to evaluate credit risk using Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier.  The models are compared using confusion matrices and classification reports.
